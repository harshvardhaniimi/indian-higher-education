# Technical Efficiency of Indian Higher Educational Institutes
Measuring efficiency of major Indian higher educational institutes including Indian Institutes of Technology and Indian Institutes of Management. We also suggested policy measures that should be undertaken by the government to improve college education standards and improve efficiency of the institutes.

The project was based on actual data submitted for NIRF ranking by the institutes. We scrapped data from PDF files avaliable on NIRF's website. For paucity of time, we choose only top 50 institutes from management and engineering fields.

Project members: Harshvardhan and Tamanna Gupta.

Project guide: Prof Rahul Nilakantan

This project was done as Course of Independent Study as part of our IPM curriculum.
